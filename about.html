        <h1>About the Department</h1>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: large;"><strong>Mechanical Engineering </strong>Department was established in the year 1939 at University College of Engineering, Osmania University to offer three year degree course in Urdu medium with an initial intake of 50 students. It has since then grown significantly by spreading its academic activities in offering courses at Undergraduate level as well as Post Graduate level. The department faculty is actively involved in guiding research scholars leading to Ph.D. degree.
Currently, each year the department admits 60 students for the four year Undergraduate programme and 51 for the two year Post Graduate courses (Production Engineering, Turbomachinery and Automation & Robotics) in regular stream and 45 in part time (Production Engineering and Automation & Robotics) stream. The Department receives research and modernization grants from UGC, MHRD, AICTE and TEQIP.
To meet the required Academic standards, quality instruction is imparted to the students by the motivated and qualified faculty members providing good academic insights. To provide higher degree of perspective in the concepts of subject content, Computers and Audio-Visual equipment are extensively used. Students are especially trained to meet the current industrial requirements.
In order to keep pace with changing needs of educational standards, the department reviews and revises the course syllabus every year. In the process, the courses underwent many changes over the years thereby making them more relevant to the requirements of higher education, research and industry. The revised curriculum for BE and ME courses includes subjects like Finite Element Method, Robotic Engineering, Non-Conventional Energy Sources, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Entrepreneurship, Visual Programming, Computer Aided Modeling & Design, Composite Materials and Neural Networks & Fuzzy Logic in addition to conventional subjects. </p>
